In order to accommodate an increase in the number of patients, our new schedule will offer weekend appointments and longer hours during the workweek; we will now be open 8 A. M. - 6 P. M. , Monday - Friday, and 10 A. M. - 3 P. M. , on Saturday. We are also welcoming two additions to our staff: Dr. Anne Hui, who has been practicing dentistry for over ten years, and Ellen Howard, our new dental assistant. \r\nFor detailed directions to the new location, see the enclosed map. Please note that Exit 9 is the nearest exit if you are driving on the Benson Highway. The nearest light rail station is Grosvenor Street.\r\nDr. Charles Somerville",

            "textQuestion" : "Hochstein to Be Headed by \r\nBarrault Bondy Executive\r\nFebruary 10 - Recent movement of executives among the fashion industry's leading companies appears not to be ending anytime soon. Hochstein Shoes, Inc. , Swiss-based retailer and manufacturer of men's shoes, announced today that its chief executive officer, Gerard Hullot, will retire, and that Angelica Ferrara, current executive vice-president of Barrault Bondy, will take his place.\r\nExperts say the succession represents a major upset within the industry, since Barrault Bondy, the Paris-based manufacturer, is one of Hochstein's leading competitors in the high-end shoe market.\r\nHullot's departure come as little surprise, however. He had publicly indicated his desire to retire in order to write a memoir of his long career in fashion, over thirty years of which were spent at Hochstein. Nevertheless, most experts had expected him to stay on until after November, when the company's winter collection is released.\r\nFerrara's move has generated much speculation about who will take her place at Barrault Bondy. Sources there indicate that current design director Marcel Hugo will be named the new executive vice president in a press release later this week.",

            "textQuestion" : "April 16\r\nDear Ms. Gianetti:\r\nAs you may know, our office is moving to a new location at 1837 Plymouth Avenue (across the street from the Bailey supermarket). Construction is finally complete, and we will begin seeing patients there on Monday, May 2.\r\nThe new location offers twice as many as parking spaces, more examination rooms, and a larger waiting room than the old office on Eastbridge Road did. In order to accommodate an increase in the number of patients, our new schedule will offer weekend appointments and longer hours during the workweek; we will now be open 8 A. M. - 6 P. M. , Monday - Friday, and 10 A. M. - 3 P. M. , on Saturday. We are also welcoming two additions to our staff: Dr. Anne Hui, who has been practicing dentistry for over ten years, and Ellen Howard, our new dental assistant. \r\nFor detailed directions to the new location, see the enclosed map. Please note that Exit 9 is the nearest exit if you are driving on the Benson Highway. The nearest light rail station is Grosvenor Street.\r\nDr. Charles Somerville",
